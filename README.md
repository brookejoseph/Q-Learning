# Q-Learning Gridworld Project

## Overview

This project implements a Q-Learning algorithm in a Gridworld environment. The agent learns through experience by interacting with the environment and updating its Q-values based on the rewards received. The objective is to train the agent to achieve the highest possible total reward.

### Key Features:
- Q-Learning algorithm implementation
- Training over 1000 episodes
- Visualization of Q-values for each action (Up, Right, Down, Left)
- Progress tracking of total rewards over time

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This is the main script where the Q-learning algorithm is implemented and the environment is simulated.
- `q_learning.py`: Contains utility functions for plotting and visualization.
